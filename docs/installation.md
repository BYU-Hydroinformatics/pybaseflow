# Installation

## From PyPI

The simplest way to install baseflowx is from the Python Package Index:

```bash
pip install baseflowx
```

This will install baseflowx along with its required dependencies: **numpy**, **numba**, and **pandas**. These are pulled in automatically by pip, so no extra steps are needed for a working installation.

baseflowx requires **Python 3.9 or later**. It is tested on Python 3.9 through 3.13.

## Optional dependencies

**matplotlib** is not installed automatically but is needed if you want to plot hydrographs or baseflow results. You can install it separately:

```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

## Development install

If you want to contribute to baseflowx or run its test suite, clone the repository and install in editable mode with the development extras:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ciroh-ua/baseflowx.git
cd baseflowx
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

The `[dev]` extra installs **pytest** and **matplotlib** in addition to the core dependencies, giving you everything needed to run the tests and generate figures.

## A note about Numba

baseflowx uses [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/) to JIT-compile several performance-critical inner loops (HYSEP interval methods, UKIH turning-point detection, and the BFlow filter). The first time you import baseflowx -- or the first time you call a Numba-accelerated function with a new argument signature -- you may notice a pause of a few seconds while Numba compiles the relevant functions to machine code. This is a one-time cost per Python session; subsequent calls to the same function will execute at compiled speed. Numba caches its compiled output on disk, so even across sessions the compilation overhead is typically only incurred once after installation or after a baseflowx version upgrade.
