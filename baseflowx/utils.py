def backward(Q, b_LH, a):

    Calculates the baseflow time series `b` from the discharge time series `Q` and the baseflow time series `b_LH` using a backward recursive approach.

    The function iterates through the discharge time series in reverse order, calculating the baseflow at each time step based on the baseflow at the next time step and the recession coefficient `a`. If the calculated baseflow exceeds the discharge at the current time step, the baseflow is set to the discharge.
